# Java Recipe Finder
 The Java Recipe Finder is a Web Application I wrote that uses a food API ( provided by https://spoonacular.com/food-api ) to return items that match the Users search terms. The User can then click on a item to be taken to it's recipe page.
 
 You can access the app here - https://devaaron7.github.io/Java-Recipe-Finder/
 
 ### Features 
 ## Recipe Search By Title
 - With the title search button selected, enter a search term to return up to 3 items that include the term in there name
 example - searching "Blueberry" can return "Blueberry Cheesecake" , "Blueberry Crisp" & "Blueberry Raspberry Pie"

 ## Search By Ingredients
 - With the ingredient search button selected, enter an ingredient that is included with a recipe that your looking for. This is great if you don't know what to make, but have lose ingredients in your fridge.
 ex - adding tags "sugar" & "milk" can return "Lemon Ricotta Pancakes" & "Parmesan Cheddar Brioche"
